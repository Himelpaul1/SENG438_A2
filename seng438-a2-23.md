# 1 Introduction

In this lab we tested a variety of functions provided by the teaching team at SENG 438. Each member had a set of functions they had to test, and were responsible for setting up there testing environment. We had an opportunity to practice black box testing techniques such as boundary values and equivalence classes. Furthermore, Some major benefits of using mock objects while conducting tests is that they allow you to mimic object behaviour. This allows us to test an object without having to create complete objects. This is a huge advantage as some objects only occur in certain scenarios, so you would have to have a large portion of your program running just to test a singular function. This saves both time, memory and energy when conducting tests. However the drawbacks are that when making mocks, you are not testing a function with the real object that it would interact with otherwise. Furthermore, not all test cases require mocks, so defining them in certain situations can prove wasteful.

# 2 Detailed description of unit test strategy

To formulate test cases, we separated each of the functions under test into equivalence classes. Each test may have had unique equivalence classes. So each time a test was performed we defined the equivalence classes. Under each function you will find all of our equivalence classes, which could then be used to find partitions, as well as boundary values. Each function will also indicate the boundary values used for testing.

# 3 Test cases developed

## Functions tested for DataUtilities



### DataUtilities() Test list:
- testCalculateColumnTotal tests calculateColumnTotal(data, columnIndex), verifying correct computation of column totals across different indices.
- testCalculateRowTotal tests calculateRowTotal(data, rowIndex), ensuring accurate row total calculations for different indices.
- testCreateNumberArray tests createNumberArray(double[]), checking if a primitive double array correctly converts to a Number[] array.
- testCreateNumberArray2D tests createNumberArray2D(double[][]), ensuring proper conversion of a 2D primitive array to a Number[][] array.
- testGetCumulativePercentages tests getCumulativePercentages(DefaultKeyedValues), verifying that cumulative percentages are correctly computed for a sequence of values.


## Function tested for Range



### Range() test list:
- testGetLowerBound tests getLowerBound(), covering negative and positive range values.
- testGetUpperBound tests getUpperBound(), ensuring correct retrieval of upper bound in different ranges.

## Test Cases for Mocking

#### Method: calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)
- test1CalculateColumnTotal(): Tests column total with positive values to ensure correct summation.

- test3CalculateColumnTotalTwoNeg(): Tests column total with only negative values to check proper summation.
- test4CalculateColumnTotalZeroRows(): Tests column total when row count is zero, ensuring it returns 0.0.
- testCalculateColumnTotalNull(): Tests behavior when null is passed as input, expecting an exception.
#### Method: calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)
- test1CalculateRowTotal(): Tests row total calculation with positive values to confirm correct summation.
- test2CalculateRowTotalNegPosValue(): Tests row total with mixed positive and negative values to ensure proper addition.
#### Method: createNumberArray(double[] data)
- testCreateNumberArray(): Verifies conversion of a valid double[] array into a Number[] array, ensuring correctness.
#### Method: createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)
- testCreateNumberArray2DNull(): Checks behavior when null is passed as input, expecting an exception.
#### Method: getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)
- testGetCumulativePercentages(): Tests calculation of cumulative percentages for valid KeyedValues, ensuring correctness in summation and percentage distribution.





# 4 How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The work was divided by assigning members to test different functions. Most members tested 3 functions, while there was one who tested 2 JUnit test cases. That person was tasked with formatting the report. Each member had to outline the equivalence classes, boundary values, and partitions for their functions. They also had to write how they were going to approach their test, whether that be weak-normal test or not. As we had to a total of 15 test cases (10 for RangeTest, 5 for DataUtilitiesTest), and our group has 5 persons in total the work was distributed equally and everyone was satisfied with their part. 

# 5 Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

An obstacle encountered was setting up the testing environment on a local machine. Most members had several issues before they could even start testing. This was overcome by asking other members for help, and everyone was able to get it setup. Another obstacle was how to properly use Mock objects in a test case, as it was our first time using Mock objects. The issue was that certain tests did not require mock objects, and it was up to the user to identify where they would be needed and how to initialize them for their purposes. The most significant lesson learnt was to better prepare for upcoming labs, as there was certainly a time constraint for this one.

# 6 Comments/feedback on the lab itself

The lab itself showed us the essentials of black box testing, and how to plan and implement tests. Members learnt more about etc, partitions and boundary values, as well as their significance when creating tests. Group members also communicated and conducted research to create the best possible overall tests.
